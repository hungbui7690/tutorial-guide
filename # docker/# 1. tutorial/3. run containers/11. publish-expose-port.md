## Explanation
If you've been following the guides so far, you understand that containers provide isolated processes for each component of your application. Each component - a React frontend, a Python API, and a Postgres database - runs in its own sandbox environment, completely isolated from everything else on your host machine. 
This isolation is great for security and managing dependencies, but it also means you can’t access them directly. For example, you can’t access the web app in your browser.

That’s where `port publishing` comes in.


## Publishing ports
Publishing a port provides the ability to break through a little bit of networking isolation by setting up a forwarding rule. 
As an example, you can indicate that requests on your host’s port `8080` should be forwarded to the container’s port `80`. Publishing ports happens during container creation using the `-p` (or `--publish`) flag with `docker run`. The syntax is:

```bash
docker run -d -p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT nginx
```
- `HOST_PORT`: The port number on your host machine where you want to receive traffic
- `CONTAINER_PORT`: The port number within the container that's listening for connections

Now, any traffic sent to port 8080 on your host machine will be forwarded to port 80 within the container.
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

### Publishing to ephemeral ports
At times, you may want to simply publish the port but don’t care which host port is used. In these cases, you can let Docker pick the port for you. To do so, simply omit the HOST_PORT configuration.

For example, the following command will publish the container’s port 80 onto an ephemeral port on the host:
```bash
docker run -p 80 nginx

docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
a527355c9c53   nginx         "/docker-entrypoint.â¦"   4 seconds ago    Up 3 seconds    0.0.0.0:54772->80/tcp    romantic_williamson
```
In this example, the app is exposed on the host at port `54772`.


### Publishing all ports
When creating a container image, the EXPOSE instruction is used to indicate the packaged application will use the specified port. These ports aren't published by default.

With the `-P` or `--publish-all` flag, you can automatically publish all exposed ports to ephemeral ports. This is quite useful when you’re trying to avoid port conflicts in development or testing environments.

For example, the following command will publish all of the exposed ports configured by the image:
```bash
docker run -P nginx
```


## Try Out

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 docker/welcome-to-docker
```
```bash
http://localhost:8080
```

## Use Docker Compose
This example will launch the same application using `Docker Compose`:

1. Create a new directory and inside that directory, create a `compose.yaml` file with the following contents:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: docker/welcome-to-docker
    ports:
      - 8080:80
```
The `ports` configuration accepts a few different forms of syntax for the port definition. In this case, you’re using the same `HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT` used in the `docker run` command

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory you created in the previous step.
3. Use the `docker compose up` command to start the application.
4. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080.
