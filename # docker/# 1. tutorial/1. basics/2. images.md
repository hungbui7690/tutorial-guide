## Explanation
Seeing a container is an isolated process, where does it get its files and configuration? How do you share those environments?

That's where container images come in!

A container image is a standardized package that includes all of the files, binaries, libraries, and configurations to run a container.

For a PostgreSQL image, that image will package the database binaries, config files, and other dependencies. For a Python web app, it'll include the Python runtime, your app code, and all of its dependencies.

There are two important principles of images:

- Images are `immutable`. Once an image is created, it can't be modified. You can only make a new image or add changes on top of it.
- Container images are `composed of layers`. Each layer represented a set of file system changes that add, remove, or modify files.

These two principles let you to extend or add to existing images. For example, if you are building a `Python` app, you can start from the `Python image` and add additional layers to install your app's dependencies and add your code. This lets you focus on your app, rather than Python itself.
