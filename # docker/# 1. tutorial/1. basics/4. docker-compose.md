## Explanation
If you've been following the guides so far, you've been working with single container applications. But, now you're wanting to do something more complicated - `run databases`, `message queues`, `caches`, or a variety of `other services`. Do you install everything in a single container? Run multiple containers? If you run multiple, how do you connect them all together?

One best practice for containers is that each container should do one thing and do it well. While there are exceptions to this rule, avoid the tendency to have one container do multiple things.

You can use multiple `docker run` commands to start multiple containers. But, you'll soon realize you'll need to manage networks, all of the flags needed to connect containers to those networks, and more. And when you're done, cleanup is a little more complicated.

With `Docker Compose`, you can define all of your containers and their configurations in a single `YAML` file. If you include this file in your code repository, anyone that clones your repository can get up and running with a single command.

It's important to understand that Compose is a declarative tool - you simply define it and go. You don't always need to recreate everything from scratch. If you make a change, run `docker compose up` again and Compose will reconcile the changes in your file and apply them intelligently.

>Dockerfile versus Compose file
A Dockerfile provides instructions to build a container image while a Compose file defines your running containers. Quite often, a Compose file references a Dockerfile to build an image to use for a particular service.


### Try Out
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/todo-list-app 
cd todo-list-app
```
```bash 
docker compose up -d --build

A lot happened here! A couple of things to call out:
- Two container images were downloaded from Docker Hub - node and MySQL
- A network was created for your application
- A volume was created to persist the database files between container restarts
- Two containers were started with all of their necessary config

With everything now up and running, you can open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the site. Feel free to add items to the list, check them off, and remove them.


## Tear it down
Since this application was started using Docker Compose, it's easy to tear it all down when you're done.

In the CLI, use the docker compose down command to remove everything:
```bash 
docker compose down

[+] Running 2/2
✔ Container todo-list-app-mysql-1  Removed        2.9s
✔ Container todo-list-app-app-1    Removed        0.1s
✔ Network todo-list-app_default    Removed        0.1s
```

> Volume persistence
By default, volumes aren't automatically removed when you tear down a Compose stack. The idea is that you might want the data back if you start the stack again.
If you do want to remove the volumes, add the `--volumes` flag when running the docker compose down command:
```bash 
docker compose down --volumes
```
```bash 

```
```bash 

```
```bash 

```
```bash 

```
```bash 

```
