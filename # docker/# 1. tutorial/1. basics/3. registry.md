## Explanation
Now that you know what a container image is and how it works, you might wonder - where do you store these images?

Well, you can store your container images on your computer system, but what if you want to share them with your friends or use them on another machine? That's where the image registry comes in.

An image registry is a centralized location for storing and sharing your container images. It can be either public or private. `Docker Hub` is a public registry that anyone can use and is the default registry.

While Docker Hub is a popular option, there are many other available container registries available today, including `Amazon Elastic Container Registry(ECR)`, `Azure Container Registry (ACR)`, and `Google Container Registry (GCR)`. You can even run your private registry on your local system or inside your organization. For example, Harbor, JFrog Artifactory, GitLab Container registry etc.

### Registry vs. repository
While you're working with registries, you might hear the terms `registry` and `repository` as if they're interchangeable. Even though they're related, they're not quite the same thing.

A `registry` is a centralized location that stores and manages container images, whereas a `repository` is a collection of related container images within a registry. Think of it as a folder where you organize your images based on projects. Each repository contains one or more container images.

Example: `DockerHub` is `registry`, which contains multiple `repositories` 


## Try out
Don't worry about the specifics of the Dockerfile, as you'll learn about that in later sections.

1. Clone the GitHub repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/helloworld-demo-node
```

2. Navigate into the newly created directory.
```bash
cd helloworld-demo-node
```

3. Run the following command to build a Docker image, swapping out YOUR_DOCKER_USERNAME with your username.
```bash
docker build -t YOUR_DOCKER_USERNAME/docker-quickstart .
```

4. Run the following command to list the newly created Docker image:
```bash
docker images

REPOSITORY                                 TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
<YOUR_DOCKER_USERNAME>/docker-quickstart   latest    476de364f70e   2 minutes ago   170MB
```

5. Start a container to test the image by running the following command (swap out the username with your own username):
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 YOUR_DOCKER_USERNAME/docker-quickstart 
```

6. Use the docker tag command to tag the Docker image. Docker tags allow you to label and version your images.
```bash
docker tag <YOUR_DOCKER_USERNAME>/docker-quickstart <YOUR_DOCKER_USERNAME>/docker-quickstart:1.0 
```
You can verify if the container is working by visiting http://localhost:8080 with your browser.

7. Finally, it's time to push the newly built image to your Docker Hub repository by using the docker push command:
```bash
docker push YOUR_DOCKER_USERNAME/docker-quickstart:1.0
```

8. Open `Docker Hub` and navigate to your repository. Navigate to the Tags section and see your newly pushed image.
