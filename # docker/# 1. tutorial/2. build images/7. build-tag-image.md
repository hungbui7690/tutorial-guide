## Docker Images
Seeing a container is an isolated process, where does it get its files and configuration? How do you share those environments?

That's where container images come in!

A container image is a standardized package that includes all of the files, binaries, libraries, and configurations to run a container.

For a `PostgreSQL` image, that image will package the database binaries, config files, and other dependencies. For a Python web app, it'll include the Python runtime, your app code, and all of its dependencies.

There are two important principles of images:
1. Images are immutable. Once an image is created, it can't be modified. You can only make a new image or add changes on top of it.
2. Container images are composed of layers. Each layer represented a set of file system changes that add, remove, or modify files.

These two principles let you to extend or add to existing images. For example, if you are building a Python app, you can start from the Python image and add additional layers to install your app's dependencies and add your code. This lets you focus on your app, rather than Python itself.


## Building images
The most basic `docker build` command might look like the following:

```bash
docker build .
```
The final `.` in the command provides the `path` or `URL` to the `build context`. At this location, the builder will find the `Dockerfile` and other referenced files.


Output example:
```bash
docker build .

Start a container
```bash
$ docker run sha256:9924dfd9350407b3df01d1a0e1033b1e543523ce7d5d5e2c83a724480ebe8f00
```


## Tagging Images

```bash
[HOST[:PORT_NUMBER]/]PATH[:TAG]
```

Some examples of image names include:
- `nginx`, equivalent to `docker.io/library/nginx:latest`: this pulls an image from the `docker.io` registry, the library namespace, the `nginx` image repository, and the `latest` tag.
- `docker/welcome-to-docker`, equivalent to `docker.io/docker/welcome-to-docker:latest`: this pulls an image from the `docker.io` registry, the docker namespace, the `welcome-to-docker` image repository, and the `latest` tag

To tag an image during a build, add the `-t` or `--tag` flag:
```bash
$ docker build -t <my-username>/<my-image> .

$ docker build -t mobywhale/concepts-build-image-demo .


```

Once the build has completed, you can view the image by using the following command:
```bash
$ docker image ls

REPOSITORY                             TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
mobywhale/concepts-build-image-demo    latest    746c7e06537f   24 seconds ago   354MB
```


If you've already built an image, you can add another tag to the image by using the `docker image tag` command: 
- Create a tag TARGET_IMAGE that refers to SOURCE_IMAGE
```bash
$ docker image tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]
$ docker image tag my-username/my-image another-username/another-image:v1
```

To tag a local image with ID `0e5574283393` as `fedora/httpd` with the tag `version1.0`:
```bash
$ docker tag 0e5574283393 fedora/httpd:version1.0
```

To tag a local image `httpd` as `fedora/httpd` with the tag `version1.0`:
```bash
$ docker tag httpd fedora/httpd:version1.0
```



To push an image to a private registry and not the public Docker registry you must include the registry hostname and port (if needed).
```bash
docker tag 0e5574283393 myregistryhost:5000/fedora/httpd:version1.0
```
