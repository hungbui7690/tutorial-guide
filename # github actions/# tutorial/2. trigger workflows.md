## Using events to trigger workflows

```yaml
# single event 
on: push

# multiple events
on: [push, fork]
```

#### Activity Types
For example, the `issue_comment` event has the `created`, `edited`, and `deleted` activity types. If your workflow triggers on the `label event`, it will run whenever a `label` is `created`, `edited`, or `deleted`. If you specify the created activity type for the label event, your workflow will run when a `label` is `created` but `not` when a label is `edited` or `deleted`.

```yaml
on:
  label:
    types:
      - created

# activity types + filters with multiple events
# A label is created
# A push is made to the main branch in the repository
# A push is made to a GitHub Pages-enabled branch
on:
  label:
    types:
      - created
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  page_build:
```
