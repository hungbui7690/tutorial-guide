if we upload to render project with sequelize + sequelize migration -> we should use CommonJS instead of ES6

USE: const express = require('express')
NOT: import express from 'express'


since we will run db migration when we build our app
-> npm install && npm run build && npm run migrate && npm run seed && npm run start
