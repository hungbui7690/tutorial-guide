## Introduction

In production, we cannot `create/modify` `database/tables/columns/relationships` directly from the server.

But we should setup migrations, so the code can do that for us.


#### Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev sequelize-cli
```

To create `migration` from an empty project you will need to execute `init` command
```bash
npx sequelize-cli init
```

This will create following folders
- `config/config.json`, contains config file, which tells CLI how to connect with database
- `models/index.js`, contains all models for your project
- `migrations`, contains all migration files
- `seeders`, contains all seed files


#### Configs

Change `config/config.json` to `config/config.js`
Modify `config.js`

```js
require('dotenv').config()

module.exports = {
  development: {
    dialect: 'postgres',
    username: process.env.PG_USERNAME,
    password: process.env.PG_PASSWORD,
    database: process.env.PG_DATABASE,
    host: process.env.PG_HOST,
    pool: { max: 20, min: 0, acquire: 30000, idle: 10000, maxUses: Infinity },
  },
  production: {
    dialect: 'postgres',
    username: process.env.PG_USERNAME,
    password: process.env.PG_PASSWORD,
    database: process.env.PG_DATABASE,
    host: process.env.PG_HOST,
    dialectOptions: {
      ssl: {
        require: true,
        rejectUnauthorized: false,
      },
    },
    pool: { max: 20, min: 0, acquire: 30000, idle: 10000, maxUses: Infinity },
  },
}
```


#### Create the first Model and Migration

The command below will create `models/User.js` and `migrations/xxx_user.js`
```bash
npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name User --attributes firstName:string,lastName:string,email:string
```

The `models/` does not have anything related to migrations
If we want don't want to run migration, but also want to create table in DB based on our models, we can use the command below: 

```js
User.sync() - This creates the table if it doesn't exist (and does nothing if it already exists)
User.sync({ force: true }) - This creates the table, dropping it first if it already existed
User.sync({ alter: true }) - This checks what is the current state of the table in the database (which columns it has, what are their data types, etc), and then performs the necessary changes in the table to make it match the model.
```

Or we can sync all models at once
```js
await sequelize.sync({ force: true });
console.log('All models were synchronized successfully.');
```

This is the usage of model. But not related to migrations.


#### Modify `migrations/xxx_user.js`

For migrations, we don't use `models/`. But we need to modify `migrations/` 

For example: 
```js
module.exports = {
  up: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.createTable('User', {
      name: Sequelize.DataTypes.STRING,
      isAdmin: {
        type: Sequelize.DataTypes.BOOLEAN,
        defaultValue: false,
        allowNull: false,
      },
    });
  },
  down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.dropTable('User');
  },
};
```


#### package.json

```json
"script" : {
  "migrate-create": "npx sequelize-cli migration:create",
  "migrate-db": "npx sequelize-cli db:migration",
  "migrate-down:": "npx sequelize-cli db:migration:undo"
}
```


#### Migrate to DB

```bash
npm run migrate
```
This command will create the real table in DB.
This also create `SequelizeMeta` table in DB as well. This table is the migration history.


#### Add another migration

Now, if we want to add new column to table User, we `don't` modify the User model, but will generate another migration by using the command below

```bash
npm migrate:generate --name add-column
```

```js
module.exports = {
  up: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.addColumn(
      'User',
      'address',
      {
        type: Sequelize.DataTypes.STRING,
      },
    ),
  },
  down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.removeColumn('address')
  },
}
```

#### Migrate New Stuff to DB

```bash
npm run migrate
```
This command will alter `User` table and add `address` column.


If we check the db, we will see `address` table


#### Undo the migration

If we want to undo the migration, we need to rollback by running `npm run migrate:down`

After we run this, the previous migration will be gone. `address` column will be removed


#### Seeds

We use `seeds` to populate data to our table

```bash
npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name demo-user
```

Modify `seeds/xxx_demo-user.js`:
```js
module.exports = {
  up: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    await queryInterface.bulkInsert('User', [
      {
        name: 'John',
        email: 'example@example.com',
        createdAt: new Date(),
      },
    ]);
  },
  down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.bulkDelete('User', null, {});
  },
}

```

Running Seeds

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```

Undoing Seeds
```bash
# If you wish to undo the most recent seed:
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo

# If you wish to undo a specific seed:
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo --seed name-of-seed-as-in-data

# Undo all seeds
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all
```

**Note**: Seeds don't store history in `SequelizeMeta` table
